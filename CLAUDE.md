## Project

Koszykomat — price-comparison web app for Polish supermarket chains (Lidl vs Biedronka). Laravel 13, PHP 8.5, MySQL 8.0, Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite 8, Blade views. Solo MVP project.

Product and stack decisions live in `context/foundation/`:
- Requirements: @context/foundation/prd.md
- Stack rationale: @context/foundation/tech-stack.md

## Commands — always via ddev

All PHP, Composer, npm, and artisan commands run inside ddev containers. Never run PHP on the host.

```bash
ddev start                      # start containers (nginx-fpm, PHP 8.5, MySQL 8.0)
ddev artisan migrate            # any artisan command
ddev composer test              # run tests (clears config, then phpunit)
ddev artisan test tests/Feature/SomeTest.php   # single test file
ddev npm run dev                # Vite dev server
ddev npm run build              # production frontend build
ddev composer lint              # check code style (Pint, Laravel preset)
ddev composer fix               # auto-fix code style
```

## Hard constraints

- **MySQL 8.0** — production database is MySQL 8.0 on the DirectAdmin VPS, created via the DirectAdmin panel; local ddev runs the same major version. The DB is local to the app server (no remote RTT), but still eager-load relations and avoid N+1 so basket comparison stays within the <2 s budget.
- **PHP 8.5** — `composer.json` requires `php ^8.5`, matching the server, ddev, and CI; don't require packages needing newer PHP.
- Production compute and database are both on a classic DirectAdmin VPS (nginx + PHP-FPM + MySQL + cron), not containerized — ddev is local-only.

## Language

- User-facing strings (Blade views, validation messages, emails): **Polish**.
- Code, comments, commit messages, docs: **English**.

## Conventions

- Testing: optional during MVP — except the four promo mechanics (simple promo price, 1+1 gratis, second for 1 PLN/grosz, loyalty-card price): each must have a PHPUnit test asserting the computed basket total. Tests use in-memory SQLite.
- Git: solo project, small commits straight to `main`, conventional-commit style messages.
- Auth per PRD is OAuth-only (no email+password) — Laravel Socialite is planned but not yet installed.

## Gotchas

- Tailwind v4 is wired through the Vite plugin (`@tailwindcss/vite`), not PostCSS — no `tailwind.config.js`; theme customization goes in `resources/css/app.css` via `@theme`.
- The production MySQL database lives on the VPS itself — there are **no managed backups**. Schedule backups yourself (DirectAdmin's backup feature or a `mysqldump` cron), or a server failure loses all price/basket data.
- Use `utf8mb4` (already the default in `config/database.php`) for all tables — Polish product names and promo descriptions contain characters that the legacy `utf8` (3-byte) charset cannot store.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 2

Turn one roadmap item into the first implementation cycle with the **change planning chain**:

```
/10x-roadmap -> /10x-new -> /10x-plan -> /10x-plan-review -> /10x-implement
```

`/10x-new`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, and `/10x-implement` are the lesson focus. `/10x-frame` and `/10x-research` are not required rituals here; they are escalation paths introduced in the next lesson.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Change setup (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-new <change-id>` | You selected a roadmap item and need a stable change folder. Creates `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` so planning, implementation, progress, commits, and later review all share one identity. Use AFTER roadmap selection, BEFORE `/10x-plan`. |
| **Planning (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` | You have a change folder and need a reviewable implementation plan. Reads roadmap context, foundation docs, codebase evidence, and any existing change notes; writes `plan.md` and `plan-brief.md` with phases, file contracts, success criteria, and `## Progress`. |
| **Plan readiness (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-plan-review <change-id>` | You have `plan.md` and need a light pre-code readiness check. Use it to catch missing end state, weak contracts, malformed progress, scope drift, or blind spots before code changes begin. |
| **Implementation (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | You have an approved plan and want to execute one phase with verification, manual gate, commit ritual, and SHA write-back to `## Progress`. |
| **Lifecycle closure** | |
| `/10x-archive <change-id>` | A change is merged or intentionally closed. Move it out of active `context/changes/` into archive state. |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-new` creates the durable change identity.
- `/10x-plan` turns that identity into an implementation contract.
- `/10x-plan-review` checks the plan before the agent mutates code.
- `/10x-implement` executes one planned phase, verifies, asks for manual confirmation when needed, commits, and records progress.

### Lesson boundaries

- Plan is the default router after roadmap selection. Start with `/10x-plan` unless the problem is unclear or external evidence is blocking.
- Do not run `/10x-frame + /10x-research` as ceremony for every change.
- Do not turn this lesson into a full end-to-end product build. A checkpoint with a planned and partially or fully implemented stream is valid.
- Code review of the implemented diff belongs to Lesson 3 via `/10x-impl-review`.
- Lifecycle closure via `/10x-archive` after a change is merged or intentionally closed.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - upstream roadmap
- `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` - change identity
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan-brief.md` - compressed handoff
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
